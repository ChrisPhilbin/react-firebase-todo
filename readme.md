# React Firebase Todo App

The todo app - The quintessential app that nearly every developer makes in order to get a better understanding of how a particular framework implements and utilizes CRUD functions.

I set out to broaden my skillset and wanted to gain experience utilizing Firebase. I have found through experience that I really enjoy utilizing React for my front end and given it is so agnostic when it comes to what backend it's able to leverage I opted to go with Firebase.
